# p1-text-generation-starter

App modification:
Add a level of complexity and Add one additional type of replacement
0. I keep the basic level of complexity and replacement from our example
and add
1. the entire grammar template is randomly generated by group called "event"
2. called two different group from one group. For example, "$weapon and $outsider" from weapon group


Description :
By clicking [reroll it], the app will randomly generate one event from events pool, and that event is also made by random things.


Artist statement:
I tried a lot of things. For example, add for/if loop into the given function, so if event1 is used, it calls filler1, and if the event2 
is used, it calls filter2. But I think it maybe better if I make a text outside and (Kinda know how to do it, but didn't try this time).

Also, I want to make the every random group unique. If I get "$adventure and $adventure", I want to make the second adventure different from
first one, but unfortunately, I don't know how to do it........

But I tried as much as possible to make this "hello world" app fun!!
